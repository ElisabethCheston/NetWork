                    Documentation related complaints: <br>

                    While the documentation can most certainly be improved,
                    I am adhering to the debatable principle that keeping open issues around with respect
                    to documentation is not very helpful in improving things. Please step in and file
                    a pull request if you feel there is something unclear. <br><br>

                    Project specific integration trouble: <br>
                    In cases where allauth is just one piece of the
                    puzzle and for example a stack trace indicates another module crashing, please try to
                    come up stripped version of the issue where it is clear that allauth is the one that
                    is misbehaving.

            <h4> Contract</h4>
            <p>
                By creating, becoming an User (as defined below), or continuing as an User
                of a page (the “Page”) on our Business Services, you are agreeing to enter into legally
                binding contract terms between BizNet (as defined below and also referred to as “we”,“us”
                and “our” ) and your Organization (as defined below) represented by the Page. “Organization”
                means the business represented by your Page, which may only be a legal entity
                (such as a university or company) or you, if you are operating the business in your individual
                capacity (such as a sole proprietorship). You also represent and warrant that you are authorized
                to enter into these contract terms on behalf of the Organization (collectively with the
                Organization, you and the other Users, if any, “You”). <br><br>

                If You do not agree to this contract (the “Contract” or “Service Terms”), do not register as an
                User and do not access or otherwise use any of our Business Services (including creating,
                claiming or continuing as an User for the Page). <br><br>

                In addition to the Service Terms, the BizNet User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy
                apply to any use of our services. Additional terms may apply to specific features. For example,
                if You purchase premium features for the Page, such features may be subject to additional terms
                and payment obligations.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Obligations</h4>
            <p>

                You acknowledge and agree that: <br>

            <ul>
                <li>The Page must have at least one User identified for the Page. </li>

                <li>Each User of the Page must be a current registered member of BizNet.com (“Member”) with correct

                acquisitions or other restructuring. Please Contact Us with requests related to the Page. <br><br>

                Content and Conduct. You agree that: <br>

            <ul>

                    the Page (such as all posts, additions, and deletions) comply with all applicable laws.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Compliance with Data Policies: <br>

                As with our other BizNet services, our collection, use and sharing of Your personal data is subject
                to our Privacy Policy (which includes our Cookie Policy and other documents referenced in the Privacy
                Policy) and updates. You agree that You will comply with the Service Terms when collecting, using or
                otherwise processing any personal data related to Members. <br> <br>
                If You process data about Members
                (obtained either directly from BizNet services, from any third party application that has integrated
                with BizNet's APIs, or otherwise), You must ensure that You have a legal basis for doing so and that
                Your processing is in compliance with applicable laws (including by clearly informing the Members about
                Your processing and obtaining their unambiguous consent where necessary). You are responsible for Your
                and Your agents’ processing of this data, including with respect to any secondary uses, disclosures or
                transfers of the data. <br> <br>

                Company Page Insights: <br>

                The provision of information available to Users under the Page Analytics tab (“Page Insights”),
                if any, is subject to our Page Insights Joint Controller Addendum (the “Addendum”), which forms part
                of these Service Terms.

            <h4>Intellectual Property</h4>
            <p>
                License: <br>

                You grant to BizNet (and its affiliates) a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free,
                sublicensable and transferable license to use, copy, modify, distribute and publish any content
                You provide to BizNet. The foregoing license survives termination of this Contract with regard
                to content provided prior to termination. You represent and warrant that you own or have all necessary
                rights (including intellectual property rights) to such content (including to grant the license above).
                <br> <br>

                Feedback and Reservations of Rights: <br>

                If You choose to provide suggestions and feedback to BizNet, You agree that BizNet (and its
                affiliates)
                can (but does not have to) use and share such feedback for any purpose without compensation to You. You
                may not disclose any information about our metrics or Member demographics. BizNet (and its affiliates)
                reserve all of our intellectual property rights in the Business Services.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Page Service Limits</h4>
            <p>
                You acknowledge and agree that: <br>

                Any User’s identity and actions related to the Page may be visible to others, including visitors
                and other Users of the Page. We may add or suspend any User’s access to the Business Services
                (including administration of the Page) at any time at our own discretion. <br>

                We may change or discontinue any of our services, including Business Services. In addition, BizNet
                reserves the right to remove any Page on the Business Services at any time without notice, including
                all, or part of, the Page’s content. <br><br>

                We may modify the Page in accordance with our policies. For example, we may modify the Organization name
                on the Page and add clarification statements to the Page to address member confusion or conflicting
                trademark rights. In addition, we may (a) restrict any name change and have no obligations to perform
                any change, merger or other request, and (b) determine how name changes will be represented on profiles
                and on other references to the Organization on BizNet services. <br> <br>

                We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Business Services (or other services)
                and can remove it in our sole discretion, with or without notice. BizNet may be required by law to
                remove certain information or content in certain countries. <br> <br>

                We do not promise to store or keep showing any information and content that You have posted. We have no
                obligation to store, maintain or provide You a copy of any content or information that You or others
                provide, except to the extent required by applicable laws and as noted in our Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Modification and Termination</h4>
            <p>
                Modification of Contract: <br>

                We may modify this Contract from time to time. If we make material changes to the Contract, we will
                attempt to provide You notice through our Business Services (or by other means) to provide You the 
                opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be 
                retroactive. If You object to any changes, You may terminate Your agreement to this Contract, 
                however if You do not terminate Your agreement to this Contract, Your continued use of our 
                Business Services after we publish or otherwise notify You about our changes to these terms means 
                that You are consenting to the updated terms. <br><br>


                Termination of Contract: <br>

                If You wish to terminate this Contract, at any time You can do so by (1) removing all Users of the Page,
                including Yourself (and others, if applicable); (2) deactivating the Page; (3) if you are the only User, 
                closing your BizNet account; and/or (4) notifying BizNet through Contact Us. BizNet has no obligation 
                to de-activate the Page (even after termination). BizNet may terminate this Contract by de-activating 
                the Page and/or by providing notice to at least one User or otherwise to the Organization.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
            <p>
                You may not rely on any undertaking, promise, assurance, statement, representation, warranty or
                understanding of any person
                relating to the subject matter of the Contract, other than as stated in the Contract. We may notify you
                within the Business
                Services or via the contact information of one or more Users provided us (e.g., email, mobile number,
                physical address of any
                User and/or Organization). You agree to keep your contact information up to date. BizNet accepts
                service of process at the
                address identified here. Any notices that You provide without compliance with this Section shall have no
                legal effect. <br>

                If we do not act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that BizNet has waived its
                right to enforce this
                Contract. The Contract does not create a partnership, agency relationship, or joint venture between the
                parties. Neither party
                has the power or authority to bind the other or to create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of
                the other. Under no
                circumstances will any employee of one party be deemed to be the employee of the other. You may not
                assign this Contract in whole
                or in part without BizNet’s prior written consent. Any attempted assignment in violation of this
                restriction is void. <br>

                The Contract shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and
                permitted assigns. If the
                Contract is translated into a language other than English, the translation is for convenience only, and
                the English language
                version will govern. BizNet may remotely monitor Your use of the Business Services to ensure
                compliance with the Contract.
                If any provision of the Contract is unenforceable, that provision will be modified to render it
                enforceable to the extent
                possible to give effect to the parties’ intentions and the remaining provisions will not be affected.
